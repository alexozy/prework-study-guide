# Prework Study Guide Webpage

## Description

- What was your motivation? This study guide was created to accomplish three important tasks. The first was to become familiar with the bootcamp learning platform, HTML, CSS, JavaScript, and also create a project from the beginings stages through to deployment. Along the way, if bugs or challenges were encountered the student would be able to utilize tutoring, the internet and other resources to successfully work through these challenges.

- This guide allows the student to get a "taste" of basic coding and become familiar with terms and practices expected during the bootcamp. It has also provided a useful study tool to utilize during bootcamp as well.

- Ultimately, I learned that even when some of the assignments got challenging I had the tools to navigate them. I even made note of some of those challenges on the study guide as a reminder for future projects.

## Usage

This Prework Study Guide contains four sections: HTML, CSS, JavaScript, and GIT. Each section contains notes and reminders specific to that coding language that will aid in learning more about how each of these interact with each other or alone. You will also find that navigating to the DevTools console in Chrome, that JavaScript is running. This feature will randomly choose a topic for us to study from the list of topics we have covered in the prework modules. This is not a final study guide, as I learn more I can include more bullet points.
